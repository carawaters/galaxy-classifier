# galaxy-classifier

Uses galaxy data obtained from the Galaxy Zoo project, put together into a .npy file by the University of Sydney for their course on Data-driven Astronomy at Coursera.

Explores using a simple decision tree classifier as well as cross validation and a random forest method for classifying galaxies into elliptical, spiral or mergers.
Evaluates the accuracy of each and gives a confusion matrix.
